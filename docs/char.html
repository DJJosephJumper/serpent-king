      <strong>Dill</strong> is a vulnerable musician starting his senior year of
      high school. His imprisoned father who he was named after, Pastor Dillard
      Early Sr. was famous for having his congregation handle dangerous snakes
      and drink chemicals. His family is in serious debt, so his parents don't
      want him to go to college. He is often ridiculed about his father at
      school, though his two friends, Lydia and Travis, help get him through it.
      However, he isn't brave enough to share his feelings for Lydia or his
      music.

      <strong>Lydia</strong> comes from a supportive upper-middle-class family
      and runs a popular fashion blog called <em>Dollywould</em>. She feels out
      of place in their rural Tennessee town, with her unusual fashion style and
      intense sarcasm, and wants to get herself out of there.

      <strong>Travis</strong> is a gentle giant. He is obsessed with the fantasy
      book series <em>Bloodfall</em> and a girl he met online that loves it too.
      He insists on bringing his dragon necklace and homemade staff everywhere.
      Often, he dreams of living in a fantasy world and escaping his abusive
      father.
