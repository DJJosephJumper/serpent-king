      <strong>Liam's paragraph:</strong> "The Paper Crane Society is fighting to
      end the genocides in Syria. We chose to fight genocide for
      many reasons. First we believe that no group of people should
      be discriminated to such an extent that they are executed
      whether they are men women child innocent or criminals. Next
      we believe that every the people in Syria deserve to live long
      fulfilling lives because that is a right everyone should be
      able to have. Also we cannot prevent the genocides that have
      happened throughout history but we want to bring awareness so
      genocides will not be repeated in the future. We hope that we
      will never have to witness genocides or any discrimination
      against a group of innocents people and we will stand up for
      those being oppressed. We want people to stop risks of genocide
      before it is to late."

      <strong>Joseph's paragraph:</strong> "We are the Paper Crane
      Society, made up of Joey, Joseph, Michael, Liam, and Gaby. We
      are fighting to stop the genocides currently going on in the
      world (specifically in Syria). We chose to fight for this because
      it is a problem not getting as much attention as it needs compared
      to other world news circulating right now. There are hundreds of
      thousands of Syrians dead due to the horrible nature of some of
      the people there, with many more fatalities to occur. We want to
      be part of the solution by helping raise awareness of this tragedy;
      to spread the word. We hope our work and the works of other similar
      organizations will be enough to get more people to pay attention
      and support the victims of the genocide. We hope that our efforts
      will be enough to save the lives of people in not just Syria, but
      other places around the world."

      <strong>Joey's Paragraph:</strong> "Our group, The Paper Crane Society, believes that genocide
      in Syria is a problem that must be dealt with. The Paper Crane
      Society is fighting to end the genocides in Syria. We chose
      to fight genocide for many reasons. The first reason is, we
      have so much to lose. If Syria continues to act as it is,
      then our society is in ruins already. My second reason is,
      all of the hope for the world will be limited. The only thing
      that will give us any hope could be the military and our
      loved ones, if we have any left. My third reason is that we
      could all die. All life on earth will die after the humans
      die because most of the plants today are being taken care of
      my humans. The sad thing is that there are still people that
      donâ€™t know about any of the genocide in Syria."

      <strong>Gaby's Paragraph:</strong> "I choose to fight to end
      mass murder, because I believe it needs to stop, incessant
      people and kids are getting hurt for no reason. Mass murder is
      when people are going around bombing, killing, shooting people
      and kids for no reason. For example the 2018 Las Vegas Shooting,
      the Oklahoma City bombing. I hope this will stop, and incessant
      people will stop getting hurt, because of someone dumb. It is
      little wonder that while shooting clearly signaled this desire
      for gun control measures to abate the killing, has also sounded
      increasingly hopeless that it will happen. Many things have been
      written and will continue to be written on America's gun ownership
      rate the highest in the world, its gun violence the worst in the
      developed world, and the political and social forces that keep
      this from changing."
