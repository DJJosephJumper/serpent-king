      <strong>Liam's paragraph:</strong> "The Paper Crane Society is fighting to
      end the genocides in Syria. We chose to fight genocide for
      many reasons. First we believe that no group of people should
      be discriminated to such an extent that they are executed
      whether they are men women child innocent or criminals. Next
      we believe that every the people in Syria deserve to live long
      fulfilling lives because that is a right everyone should be
      able to have. Also we cannot prevent the genocides that have
      happened throughout history but we want to bring awareness so
      genocides will not be repeated in the future. We hope that we
      will never have to witness genocides or any discrimination
      against a group of innocents people and we will stand up for
      those being oppressed. We want people to stop risks of genocide
      before it is to late."

      <strong>Joseph's paragraph:</strong> "We are the Paper Crane
      Society, made up of Joseph, Joseph, Michael, Liam, and Gaby. We
      are fighting to stop the genocides currently going on in the
      world (specifically in Syria). We chose to fight for this because
      it is a problem not getting as much attention as it needs compared
      to other world news circulating right now. There are hundreds of
      thousands of Syrians dead due to the horrible nature of some of
      the people there, with many more fatalities to occur. We want to
      be part of the solution by helping raise awareness of this tragedy;
      to spread the word. We hope our work and the works of other similar
       organizations will be enough to get more people to pay attention
       and support the victims of the genocide. We hope that our efforts
       will be enough to save the lives of people in not just Syria, but
       other places around the world."
