      Liam's paragraph: "The Paper Crane Society is fighting to
      end the genocides in Syria. We chose to fight genocide for
      many reasons. First we believe that no group of people should
      be discriminated to such an extent that they are executed
      whether they are men women child innocent or criminals. Next
      we believe that every the people in Syria deserve to live long
      fulfilling lives because that is a right everyone should be
      able to have. Also we cannot prevent the genocides that have
      happened throughout history but we want to bring awareness so
      genocides will not be repeated in the future. We hope that we
      will never have to witness genocides or any discrimination
      against a group of innocents people and we will stand up for
      those being oppressed. We want people to stop risks of genocide
      before it is to late.
