      <strong>Liam's PEA:</strong> "Our group, The Paper Crane Society, believes
      that genocide in Syria is a problem that must be dealt with.
      On the website iamsyria.org, it says about 3,812 civilians
      have been killed in 2018. This shows that if we don’t do anything,
      these deaths will not stop. We must stand up and stop this
      before more people lose their lives."

      <strong>Michael's PEA:</strong> "Our group, the Paper Crane Society, believes
      that the ongoing genocides are a problem in the world.
      According to PBS.org, 'more than 1 in 10 Syrians have been
      wounded or killed since the beginning of the war', and that
      in total 'a staggering 47,0000 deaths have been caused by the
      conflict both directly and indirectly.' This death and
      suffering is outrageous, and the portion of people affected
      by the war is movingly disturbing."

    <p class="bio">
      <strong>Joseph's PEA:</strong> "Our group, the Paper Crane Society, believes that the Syrian
      genocide is a big problem in our world. According to
      stopgenocidenow.org, over 200,000 Syrians have died from
      2011 to now, and 10 million have been displaced. That
      evidence tells me that not enough attention has been given
      to the Syrian genocide. It makes me want to do something
      about it. Like we learned earlier in the year from Elie
      Wiesel, indifference is worse than hate. Other people can
      help by raising awareness (telling people about the Syrian
      genocide crisis), donating to support humanitarian services,
      and welcoming refugees and immigrants."

      <strong>Joey's PEA:</strong> "I chose to
      fight for the end of Genocide because it is a big problem in
      today’s society. The facts are true, according to endgenocide.org.
      The Syrian crisis began in early 2011 when Syrian President
      Bashar al-Assad began a brutal crackdown on growing peaceful
      protests throughout the country.  Syrian regime that killed
      over 1,400 people, and tortured many more. Genocide is taking
      over this world and is destroying it, the people who used
      to be be so close to you, are now your enemies. Why can’t
      we just get along? What I hope that the Paper Crane Society
      can change is the violence and torture, into something better
      than this. We are the past, present and future, but there
      might not be a future if Genocide still roams theses lands.
      Please help end the fight for Genocide."

      <strong>Gaby's PEA:</strong> "Our group, The Paper Crane Society believe that genocide in
      Syria is a problem that needs to be dealt with. One of the
      websites iamsyria.org, says about 3,812 people have been
      killed in 2018. This is important, that if we don't do many
      things, these deaths rates wont stop. We must stand up and
      stop this before more and more people lose their life for no reason."
