      Liam's PEA: "Our group, The Paper Crane Society, believes
      that genocide in Syria is a problem that must be dealt with.
      On the website iamsyria.org, it says about 3,812 civilians
      have been killed in 2018. This shows that if we donâ€™t do anything,
      these deaths will not stop. We must stand up and stop this
      before more people lose their lives."

      Michael's PEA: "Our group the Paper Crane Society believes
      that the ongoing genocides are a problem in the world.
      According to PBS.org 'more than 1 in 10 Syrians have been
      wounded or killed since the beginning of the war', and that
      in total 'a staggering 470000 deaths have been caused by the
      conflict both directly and indirectly.' This death and
      suffering is outrageous, and the portion of people affected
      by the war is movingly disturbing.
