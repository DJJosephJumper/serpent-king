    <p class="bio">
      <strong>Dill has had to wrestle with vipers his whole life—</strong>at
      home, as the only son of a Pentacostal minister who urges him to handle
      poisonous rattlesnakes, and at school, where he faces down bullies who
      target him for his father's extreme faith and very public fall from
      grace.</br>
      The only antidote to all this venom is his friendship with fellow outcasts
      Travis and Lydia. But as they are starting their senior year, Dill feels
      the coils of his future tightening around him. The end of high school will
      lead to new beginnings for Lydia, whose edgy fashion blog is her ticket
      out of their rural Tennessee town. And Travis is happy wherever he is
      thanks to his obsession with the epic book series Bloodfall and the
      fangirl who may be turning his harsh reality into real-life fantasy.
      Dill's only escapes are his music and his secret feelings for
      Lydia—neither of which he is brave enough to share. Graduation feels more
      like an ending to Dill than a beginning. But even before then, he must
      cope with another ending—one that will rock his life to the core.</br>
      Debut novelist Jeff Zentner provides an unblinking and at times comic
      view of the hard realities of growing up in the Bible Belt, and an
      intimate look at the struggles to find one's true self in the wreckage of
      the past.
